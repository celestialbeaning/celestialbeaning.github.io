## setup

* github setup guide: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site
* publish from /docs folder: change https://github.com/celestialbeaning/celestialbeaning.github.io/settings/pages
  * not the default, need to change it so it explicitly does that; readme.md then used as a readme
