## DECEMBER

i upgraded: 
* from a kalita wave with hario filters (help, i bought 800 of them and have about 700 left) to a hario switch this month.
* from a delonghi kg79 i got as a wedding present, to a mavo phantox pro aka the c40 killer
* my scale from the good old ikea baking scale to mavo's cheap and cheery offering
* my brewing stand from a cup to .. an actual stand which also doubles as something i cook with now

i DID NOT:
* buy a zp6
* buy a mac (yet)
* try the [4:6 method](https://en.philocoffea.com/blogs/blog/coffee-brewing-method) (yet)

i found this very intense brewing with the switch and a modified version of [kasuya's new recipe for it](https://comoricoffee.com/en/kasuyas-hario-switch-recipe-en/): very full bodied at
* 6 clicks on the phantox
* 15:240 (so a bit over 1:15)
