I AM GUNDA- oh wait, i need coffee first.

## reference notes

### resting & processing

| Processing Method    | Rest Period (Days) | Notes |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Natural (dry)       | 10-14 | Intense fruit flavors need time to stabilize; longer rest due to complex fermentation compounds |
| Washed             | 7-10  | Most predictable degassing; settles quickly into flavor profile |
| Semi-washed        | 8-12  | Similar to washed but slightly longer rest needed |
| Anaerobic          | 12-16 | Extended rest needed for fermentation compounds to settle |
| Double Anaerobic   | 14-18 | Longest rest period due to most complex fermentation profile |
| Honey              | 9-12  | Intermediate rest period; between washed and natural |

## extraction over/under

| Issue | Causes | Solutions |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **SOUR (Under-extraction)** | • Water temperature too low (<195°F/90°C)<br>• Grind size too coarse<br>• Brew time too short<br>• Pour too fast/aggressive<br>• Not enough agitation<br>• Too high coffee-to-water ratio | • Grind finer<br>• Use hotter water (195-205°F/90-96°C)<br>• Slow down your pour<br>• Extend total brew time<br>• Ensure even saturation |
| **BITTER (Over-extraction)** | • Water temperature too high (>205°F/96°C)<br>• Grind size too fine<br>• Brew time too long<br>• Too much agitation<br>• Water lingering in bed<br>• Too low coffee-to-water ratio | • Grind coarser<br>• Use slightly cooler water<br>• Speed up your pour<br>• Reduce total brew time<br>• Ensure proper drainage |
| **Additional Factors** | • Dark roast level<br>• Hard water<br>• Stale beans<br>• Dirty equipment | • Choose lighter roasts<br>• Use appropriate water (filtered)<br>• Use fresh beans<br>• Clean equipment regularly |

* Bloom: The initial stage of brewing where hot water is poured over the coffee grounds to release CO2 and pre-wet the coffee bed.
* Channeling: Uneven water flow through the coffee bed, leading to inconsistent extraction and a weaker brew.
* TDS: Total Dissolved Solids, referring to the amount of coffee extracted into the water, influencing the strength and mouthfeel of the brew.
* Extraction: The process of dissolving soluble compounds from coffee grounds into the water.
* Grind Size: The size of the ground coffee particles, which affects the rate of extraction and the final flavor.
* Manual Agitation: Stirring or swirling the coffee slurry during brewing to promote even extraction.
* Particle Distribution: The range of particle sizes present in ground coffee, impacting extraction uniformity.
* WDT: Weiss Distribution Technique, a method of evenly distributing coffee grounds before brewing using a thin tool like a needle.
* Turbulent Pour: Pouring water in a circular motion, creating agitation in the coffee bed.
* Laminar Flow: Pouring water in a slow, controlled manner to minimize agitation.
